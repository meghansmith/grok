            <h2>GROK is About People</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="intro">GROK is a gathering</span> of creative people who want to connect with their peers and discuss the most pressing issues of our day.  It’s a call to Greenville, SC for everyone who is tired of events where attendees sit for hours at a time and listen to speakers on stage.  It’s an event for active learning and sharing.  At GROK, every voice truly matters.  Instead of listening to speakers, GROK is built around group discussions called 10/20s.
            </p>

            <h3>10/20s</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="intro">10/20s are mediated discussions</span> between about a dozen participants. Any participant in a 10/20 can propose a topic for discussion. You can talk about software, your work environment, your personal challenges – anything that’s on your mind. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After 10 minutes of conversation, the session leader can choose to close the topic and ask for another. If the conversation is particularly interesting, the session leader can extend the clock for another 10 minutes, hence the name, “10/20s.”

            <p>
                <span class="intro">Everyone is welcome</span> at GROK. Most of the attendees are creative professionals - designers, developers, writers, artists, architects, etc. They are freelancers, employees, students, and CEOs. The magic happens because there are so many diverse perspectives in every conversation. We bring in some of the best designers and thinkers in the industry to mediate the 10/20s, so they infuse the discussions with their experience and insight. Whether you're just starting out or internet famous, you can learn a lot from the people you meet at GROK.

                "Grok flips the whole thing on its head: yes, there are a few presentations, but conversation is the attraction. That format completely overcomes the common complaint that "we could have just seen that presentation at home"."

                "Grok was just awesome. I’m inspired and excited about my work and its potential - but that’s normal for right after a conference. Grok is different because it offers information in the context of relationships. I’ve learned real lessons from real people, and these are lessons (and people) I can go back to again and again."

                "A group may consist of a designer, an entrepreneur, an architect, the CEO of a relatively large successful corporation, and a freelancer trying to decide if she should learn HTML and leave Photoshop behind. No one person has the stage. Everyone's attention is on the person who happens to be speaking."
